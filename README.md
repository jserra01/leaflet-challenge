## Name
UCF Data Analysis - Module 15 Challenge: Leaflet

## Description
Create a leaflet map showing earthquake statistics including location, magnitude, and depth.  Earthquake data obtained from [USGS GeoJSON feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) specifically the dataset for [All Earthquakes in the last 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson).
* Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes from the dataset.
* Data markers should reflect magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth by color.
* Add popups with relevant details (location, date and time, magnitude, and depth).
* Create a legend.
